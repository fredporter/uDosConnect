# Contributing to uDosConnect

Thank you for contributing to uDosConnect! This guide will help you get started with the development workflow.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18)
- npm (>= 9)
- Git
- Bash (or Zsh on macOS)

### 2. Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fredporter/uDosConnect.git
   cd uDosConnect
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install ESLint and related plugins:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-vue @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @eslint/js
   ```

### 3. Development Scripts

- **Build the project**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- **Lint the code**:
  ```bash
  npm run lint:check
  ```

- **Fix linting issues**:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

### 4. Pre-Commit Hooks

The project uses a pre-commit hook to ensure code quality before committing. The hook performs the following checks:

1. **VibeCLI Configuration Validation**: Validates the VibeCLI configuration.
2. **Trailing Comma Check**: Checks for trailing commas in Vue files.
3. **Linting**: Runs ESLint on Vue files to catch syntax errors and enforce code style.

If any of these checks fail, the commit will be aborted. Fix the issues and try committing again.

### 5. Scripts

The project includes several scripts to help with development:

- **`scripts/fix_comma.sh`**: Removes trailing commas from Vue files.
- **`scripts/test_modular.sh`**: Tests the modular scripting functionality.
- **`scripts/lib/file_utils.sh`**: Library of reusable functions for file operations.

### 6. CI/CD Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow runs the following checks on every push and pull request:

1. **Pre-Commit Checks**: Runs the pre-commit hook to validate the code.
2. **Linting**: Runs ESLint on Vue files.

### 7. Code Style

- Use `eslint` for linting Vue, JavaScript, and TypeScript files.
- Follow the Vue 3 style guide for Vue components.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.

### 8. Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Follow the conventional commits format:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (e.g., formatting, missing semicolons)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (e.g., updating dependencies)

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature for user authentication"
```

### 9. Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and commit them.
4. Push your changes to your fork.
5. Open a pull request to the main repository.

### 10. Issues

Report bugs and request features by opening an issue on GitHub. Include as much detail as possible.
